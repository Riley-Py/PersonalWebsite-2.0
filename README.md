# My personal Website
Here is my personal website that I created with Vue, Bootstrap and Firebase

## Why a Personal Website?

I created a personal website so that:
1. Can show off my projects in an easier format
2. Learning web development 
3. It's fun to configure it yourself and make it original


## Log: August 1st, 2023

Made a huge update to the website, by doing some refactoring, but also updating a bunch of stuff to get the website up to speed. Check out the new update if you haven't!  

## Update as of July 30th, 2024

I am going to be making a new website, using Tailwind CSS and VueJS.  I will also be using VueJS again, as what is the point of trying out React when I haven't even learned Javascript yet?  I will be using Javascript in this project to do some neat stuff (view counter is one of them).  Otherwise, this website serves as a good portfolio for all of the projects that don't have footage in the Github portfolio or on Linkedin.  Made a small update changing some stuff.
