# My personal Website
Here is my personal website that I created with Vue, Bootstrap and Firebase

## Why a Personal Website?

I created a personal website so that:
1. Can show off my projects in an easier format
2. Learning web development 
3. It's fun to configure it yourself and make it original


## Log: August 1st, 2023

Made a huge update to the website, by doing some refactoring, but also updating a bunch of stuff to get the website up to speed. Check out the new update if you haven't!  

## Update 1 on Website:
Contacts will be added, but the plan with those is to make it into a form that someone can fill out and then I get a notification on my email that states whtat that email is and what the new message is.  For this, I will have to learn how to the use the Google Firebase database, and then send it to an email address.
